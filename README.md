### Data Professionals Survey Analysis Report


---

#### **Introduction**
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of survey responses collected from data professionals. The primary objective was to understand key trends in the data industry, such as salary distributions, favorite tools and languages, education levels, and overall happiness in current roles. The dataset, cleaned and organized in SQL, was visualized using Power BI to generate actionable insights.

#### **Data Cleaning and Organization**

**Process Overview:**
The raw dataset required significant preprocessing to ensure accuracy and usability. The following steps were undertaken:

1. **Data Importation:** The dataset was imported into SQL Server, where the initial structure and inconsistencies were identified.
2. **Column Cleanup:**
   - Removed unnecessary columns such as "Email," "Browser," and "Time Spent" to streamline the dataset.
   - Renamed columns (e.g., "Q1 - Which Title Best Fits your Current Role?" to "CurrentJob") for better readability.
3. **Error Corrections:**
   - Fixed numerous typos in the "CurrentJob" column.
   - Standardized entries in the "Country" column, addressing typos and inconsistencies.
4. **Categorization:**
   - Created new columns for "JobCategory" and "IndustryCategory" using SQL `UPDATE` and `CASE` statements.
   - Grouped similar job titles and industries into meaningful categories (e.g., "Data Analyst" and "Financial Analyst" grouped under "Analytics").
5. **Salary Analysis:**
   - Transformed "YearlySalaryUSD" into "SalaryMin," "SalaryMax," and "AvgSalary" columns.
   - Categorized salaries into "Low," "Mid," and "High" based on average salary values.
6. **Additional Data Cleaning:**
   - Standardized entries in "FavoriteLanguage" (e.g., "sql" and "Sql" unified as "SQL").
   - Addressed "Other (Please Specify)" entries across multiple columns by extracting and retaining meaningful information.

**Challenges and Solutions:**
- **Challenge:** Correcting typos and inconsistencies in key columns like "CurrentJob."
  **Solution:** Used SQL string functions and manual updates to ensure uniformity.
- **Challenge:** Creating meaningful categories for job roles and industries.
  **Solution:** Implemented SQL `CASE` statements to classify entries into predefined groups.
- **Challenge:** Parsing complex salary formats.
  **Solution:** Utilized SQL functions to extract minimum, maximum, and average salary values from textual data.
